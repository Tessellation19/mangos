<h1>Heading level 1</h1> Project Proposal: Code to Play Scrabble Against
The code will play a game of scrabble with you using a 2 dimensional array to represent the board. It will always play the word that will give it the most points, regardless of stratigic moves such as blocking and crossing. The code will print a 2d array of the board and then allow you to input your word into the game. 

<h2>Heading level 2</h2> Decomposition
1. Create a two dimensional array to represent the board
2. Import the scrabble dictionary
2. Write methods to place pieces on the board
3. Write methods to tell the code what you played
4. Wrtie a method to convert a word into its scrabble value
5. Write a method that unscrambles the letters in your hand, plus one mystery letter
6. Write a series of if statements and for loops that find the best word to play
7. Find a spot on the board to play the word
8. Write code that would print the scrabble board after every turn and allow the player to type words.
<h3>Heading level 3</h3> I will learn
1. How to use 2d arrays better
2. How to use graphics in code
3. How to write more complicated ifs and fors
